[1] Using observed data sets mainly for the period 1979–2005, we find that anomalous

warming events different from conventional El Niño events occur in the central
equatorial Pacific. This unique warming in the central equatorial Pacific associated with a
horseshoe pattern is flanked by a colder sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) on
both sides along the equator. empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of monthly
tropical Pacific SSTA shows that these events are represented by the second mode that
explains 12% of the variance. Since a majority of such events are not part of El Niño
evolution, the phenomenon is named as El Niño Modoki (pseudo-El Niño) (‘‘Modoki’’ is
a classical Japanese word, which means ‘‘a similar but different thing’’). The El Niño
Modoki involves ocean-atmosphere coupled processes which include a unique tripolar sea
level pressure pattern during the evolution, analogous to the Southern Oscillation in the
case of El Niño. Hence the total entity is named as El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
Modoki. The ENSO Modoki events significantly influence the temperature and
precipitation over many parts of the globe. Depending on the season, the impacts over
regions such as the Far East including Japan, New Zealand, western coast of United States,
etc., are opposite to those of the conventional ENSO. The difference maps between the
two periods of 1979–2004 and 1958–1978 for various oceanic/atmospheric variables
suggest that the recent weakening of equatorial easterlies related to weakened zonal
sea surface temperature gradient led to more flattening of the thermocline. This appears to
be a cause of more frequent and persistent occurrence of the ENSO Modoki event during
recent decades.

1. Introduction
[2] From the point of climate variability, the year 2004
was very unusual. We start from mentioning some examples. During the summer of that year from June to September, southern India, along with some parts of northern India
experienced droughts (Figure 1a). Parts of Japan as well as
Korea also experienced severe drought and heat wave,
while Philippine Islands received surplus rainfall. A large
part of Australia experienced deficit in austral winter
rainfall. Tasmania and New Zealand, on the other hand,
received surplus precipitation. Southern Mexico and Ecuador
regions suffered from drought, whereas northern Brazil
received surplus rainfall. We notice that sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) in the equatorial Pacific showed a
peculiar zonal tripole pattern (Figure 1b): While the central
tropical Pacific was warmer than normal, it was flanked by

anomalously cooler SSTA to its east and west. This anomalous SSTA pattern is different from that during typical El
Niño events [e.g., Rasmusson and Carpenter, 1982]. The
condition continued through the following boreal winter
(figure not shown).
[3] In 2003, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) of the United States of America
revised the definition of El Niño ‘‘as a phenomenon in the
equatorial Pacific Ocean characterized by a positive sea
surface temperature departure from normal (for the 1971–
2000 base period) in the Niño 3.4 region (see Table 1 for
definition) greater than or equal in magnitude to 0.5°C,
averaged over three consecutive months.’’ (Details can be
found at http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s2095.htm.
The definition has been adopted by the World Meteorological
region IV [Larkin and Harrison, 2005a].) Larkin and
Harrison [2005a] refer to this redefined El Niño as ‘‘Dateline El Niño’’ and mention that the warming may not reach
NINO3 region during Dateline El Niño events. Interestingly,
the 2004 event is not exactly covered by this definition
because the warmer central region extends from the western
fringe of the NINO4 region rather than being just confined
to the NINO3.4 region (Figure 1b). Moreover, the western
Pacific and eastern Pacific SST anomalies during the boreal
summer of 2004 were significantly colder than normal
