## Contribution

This software is still in its very early stage. Please consider helping
by trying it out, sending issues, suggestions, ideas or contributing code.

Major features that are still lacking (I greatly appreciate any help with
any of them):

* Format citations into various citation styles, in a format suitable to paste into word
editors.
* Full text searching inside PDFs.
* Import from Zotero and EndNote.
* Other document types aside articles and books.
* Packaing into a format suitable for a few mainstream Linux software management tools.
* Of cource, any stability or performance improvements.


A few ideas that I'd like to hear from your opinions:

* An embedded PDF viewer?
* A PDF preview tab?
* Markdown syntax support in the note tab?
* Custom fields design in the meta data tab?
