        ## Contribution
        
        This software is still in its very early stage. Please consider helping by trying it out, sending issues, suggestions, ideas or contributing code.
        
        Major features that are still lacking (I greatly appreciate any help with any of them):
        
        * Format citations into various citation styles, in a format suitable to paste into word editors.
        * Full text searching inside PDFs.
        * Import from Zotero and EndNote.
        * Other document types aside articles and books.
        * Packaging into a format suitable for a few mainstream Linux package management tools.
        * Of cource, any stability or performance improvements.
        
        
        A few ideas that I'd like to hear from your opinions:
        
        * An embedded PDF viewer?
        * A PDF preview tab?
        * Markdown syntax support in the note tab?
        * Custom fields design in the meta data tab?
