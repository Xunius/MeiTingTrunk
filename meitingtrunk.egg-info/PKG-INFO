        * Oragnize documents in a folder tree, with arbitrary level of folder nesting.
        * Add a document to multiple folders without taking up duplicate storage.
        
        ### Import format
        
        * Import via bibtex files.
        * Import via RIS files.
        * Import PDF files (currently with limited meta data fetching capability).
        * Update meta data using DOI.
        
        ### Export format
        
        * Export to bibtex.
        * Export to RIS.
        * Bulk export, per folder, or per document.
        
        ### Searching and filtering
        
        * Filter document using authors, keywords, tags or publications.
        * Search meta data within folders or library.
        * Duplicate checking within folders or library.
        
        ### Note taking
        
        * Jot down your thoughts while reading, in your referred editor. (currently with limited formating options).
        
        ### Database
        
        * Meta data saved in sqlite format, transparent and easy to manipulate.

        ### Full text search (experimental)
        
        * Utilises Xapian engine to enable full text search inside attachment files (including PDFs, docs etc.).
        
        
        ### PDF preview and reader
        
        * Use `pdf.js` as a build-in PDF reader.
        * Use `poppler` to generate PDF thumbnails.
        
        ### Free and open source
        
        * Open to suggestions, bug reports and new ideas.

        ## Contribution
        
        This software is still in its very early stage. Please consider helping by trying it out, sending issues, suggestions, ideas or contributing code.
        
        Major features that are still lacking (I greatly appreciate any help with any of them):
        
        * Format citations into various citation styles, in a format suitable to paste into word editors.
        * Import from Zotero.
        * Other document types aside articles and books.
        * Packaging into a format suitable for a few mainstream Linux package management tools.
        * Of cource, any stability or performance improvements.
